ARTHEMIS is a Spotify-inspired platform for art — built to preserve, discover, and celebrate artworks that fade with time.

Not every painting hangs in a gallery.
Not every sketch lives forever.
ARTHEMIS exists to save those moments.

This is not social media.
This is a living archive for artists and art lovers.

✨ The Core Idea

Many beautiful artworks disappear as time passes.
ARTHEMIS captures them before they fade.

From notebook sketches and wall paintings to traditional and personal art styles — ARTHEMIS gives them a digital home.
